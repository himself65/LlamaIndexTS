# Introduction

Workflow is a primitive API that allows you to define a series of steps and chain by the event-driven mechanism.
It is a powerful tool to orchestrate the execution of multiple tasks in a specific order.

In this guide, we will walk you through the basic concepts of the Workflow API and how to use it in your application.

## Getting Started

<CodeBlock language="ts">{Basic}</CodeBlock>

## Context

When you want to share state between steps, you can use the `context` object.

For example, you can abstract `OpenAI` to the context level and set it after you create the workflow.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{Context}</CodeBlock>

## Dynamic Context

You can also set the context dynamically by using the `with` after you run a workflow.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{DynamicContext}</CodeBlock>

```txt
Input word or phrase: Hello, world!
OpenAI Result: Bonjour, le monde !
Ollama3.1 Result: Bonjour, monde !
```

## Complex Workflow

We can define a more complex workflow that involves multiple steps and reviews.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{ComplexWorkflow}</CodeBlock>

## Integrate with Next.js

Adding more loading indicators and error handling to the workflow, integrate with server action in Next.js.

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{ServerAction}</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{Page}</CodeBlock>
